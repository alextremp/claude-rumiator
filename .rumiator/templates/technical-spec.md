Brief description of how this feature fits into the overall system architecture.

## Technical Considerations

### Frontend Considerations
- **Design System**: Which components from the design system should be used
- **State Management**: How data should be managed (local state, global state, cache)
- **Routing**: Any new routes or navigation changes needed
- **Integration Points**: Which APIs or services to integrate with
- **Architecture Impact**: How this feature affects the current frontend architecture

### Backend Considerations
- **API Design**: High-level approach for API endpoints (RESTful, GraphQL, etc.)
- **Business Logic**: Key business rules and validation requirements
- **Data Access**: Approach for data persistence and retrieval
- **Integration Points**: External services or internal systems to integrate with
- **Architecture Impact**: How this feature affects the current backend architecture

### Security Considerations
- Authentication and authorization requirements
- Data validation and sanitization needs
- Sensitive data handling
- Rate limiting or other protection mechanisms

### Performance Considerations
- Expected load and scaling requirements
- Caching strategy (if applicable)
- Optimization needs (if applicable)
- Database indexing considerations
