## [2.0.0] - 2025-11-01

### Summary
Simplified workflow integrating business requirements directly into task creation, reducing the process from 3 phases to 2. Technical specifications now provide high-level architectural guidance instead of detailed implementation, giving developers more autonomy.

### Changed
- Updated agent: `functional-analyst` - Now creates tasks with complete business requirements (summary, user stories, acceptance criteria) in single step
- Updated agent: `architect` - Simplified to provide high-level technical guidance only (no code, APIs, or schemas)
- Updated command: `/rumiator-analyze-tech` - Simplified workflow; only technical guidance phase remains
- Updated command: `/rumiator-create-tasks` - Now includes business requirements collection; tasks created in `pending-technical-analysis` status
- Updated template: `task.yml` - Added fields: `summary`, `user_stories`, `acceptance_criteria`
- Updated template: `technical-spec.md` - Simplified format; removed API specs, data models, database schemas, and code examples
- Documentation improvements: README, GETTING-STARTED, QUICK-REFERENCE, RUMIATOR-GUIDE, EXAMPLE-WALKTHROUGH, INDEX

### Deprecated
- Command: `/rumiator-analyze-business` - No longer needed; business requirements integrated into task creation
- Separate functional spec files - Requirements now in task YAML
- Detailed technical specs with code/APIs/schemas - Now high-level guidance only

### Removed
- Business analysis phase (integrated into task creation)
- Functional spec documents (requirements now in task YAML)
- Detailed technical specifications (now high-level guidance only)

### Breaking Changes

‚ö†Ô∏è **This is a MAJOR release with breaking changes**

**What breaks:**
- `/rumiator-analyze-business` command no longer works
- Old workflow (3-phase) no longer supported
- Tasks in `pending-business-analysis` or `draft` status need manual migration
- Functional spec files no longer generated for new tasks
- Technical specs no longer include implementation details

**How to migrate:**

For existing projects with tasks in progress:

1. **Tasks in `pending-business-analysis`:**
   - Add business requirements to task YAML manually:
     ```yaml
     summary: "Brief description..."
     user_stories: ["As a...", ...]
     acceptance_criteria: ["Must...", ...]
     ```
   - Change status to `pending-technical-analysis`

2. **Tasks in `draft`:**
   - Complete the business requirements
   - Change status to `pending-technical-analysis`

3. **Update workflows:**
   - Remove `/rumiator-analyze-business` from scripts
   - Use: `/rumiator-create-tasks` ‚Üí `/rumiator-analyze-tech all`

New projects automatically use the simplified workflow.

### Migration Instructions
- **Type**: `manual`
- **Actions**:
```yaml
migrations:
  - type: "message"
    message: |
      ‚ö†Ô∏è BREAKING CHANGE: Workflow simplified from 3 phases to 2 phases

      **What changed:**
      - `/rumiator-create-tasks` now collects business requirements directly
      - Tasks are created in `pending-technical-analysis` status (not `draft`)
      - `/rumiator-analyze-business` command is DEPRECATED (no longer needed)
      - Business requirements (summary, user_stories, acceptance_criteria) are now in task YAML
      - Technical specs provide high-level guidance only (no code/APIs/schemas)

      **Migration for existing projects:**

      1. **For tasks in `pending-business-analysis` status:**
         - Manually add to task YAML:
           * `summary`: Brief description of what the task accomplishes
           * `user_stories`: List of user stories
           * `acceptance_criteria`: Testable criteria
         - Update status to `pending-technical-analysis`

      2. **For tasks with functional specs:**
         - Your existing functional specs remain valid
         - New tasks will use the integrated approach

      3. **Update your workflow:**
         - OLD: `/rumiator-create-tasks` ‚Üí `/rumiator-analyze-business all` ‚Üí `/rumiator-analyze-tech all`
         - NEW: `/rumiator-create-tasks` ‚Üí `/rumiator-analyze-tech all`

      4. **No action needed for:**
         - Completed tasks
         - Tasks in development
         - Existing documentation

  - type: "message"
    message: |
      üìã Template updates available (optional)

      The following templates have been updated:
      - `.rumiator/templates/task.yml` - Added business requirement fields
      - `.rumiator/templates/technical-spec.md` - Simplified format

      Existing projects keep their current templates.
      New projects using `/rumiator-init` will get the updated templates.

  - type: "message"
    message: |
      ü§ñ Agent behavior updated

      **functional-analyst:**
      - Now collects business requirements during task creation
      - No longer creates separate functional spec files

      **architect:**
      - Provides high-level architectural guidance only
      - Validates ADRs with user before proceeding
      - No longer writes implementation details (APIs, schemas, code)

      These changes happen automatically - no migration needed.
```
- **Description**: Major workflow simplification. Projects with tasks in progress require manual migration. See breaking changes section for details.
